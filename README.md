Exchange Rate Analysis Dashboard
This Python script utilizes the pandas and plotly libraries to create a visually appealing dashboard for analyzing exchange rates. The script reads exchange rate data from a CSV file, allows the user to choose a specific currency for analysis, and generates separate charts for weekly and monthly cart additions along with the exchange rate over time.
